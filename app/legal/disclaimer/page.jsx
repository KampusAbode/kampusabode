        <p>
          Kampus Abode provides this platform to facilitate connections between
          students (“tenants”) and property providers (“agents”). By accessing
          or using the platform, you acknowledge and agree to the following
          disclaimers:
        </p>

        <h4>1. Accuracy of Listings</h4>
        <p>
          While we encourage agents to submit accurate and up-to-date property
          information, Kampus Abode does not guarantee the accuracy,
          completeness, or reliability of any listing. Users are strongly
          advised to verify all property details independently, including
          through physical inspection where possible.
        </p>

        <h4>2. No Endorsement</h4>
        <p>
          Kampus Abode does not endorse, verify, or vouch for any agent,
          property, or third-party service featured on the platform. Inclusion
          of a listing does not imply endorsement. All interactions,
          communications, and transactions are made at the users' own discretion
          and risk.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Limitation of Liability</h4>
        <p>
          Kampus Abode is not responsible for any loss, damage, or inconvenience
          arising from the use of the platform. This includes, but is not
          limited to, issues related to property condition, misleading listings,
          missed appointments, or disputes between users. Your use of the
          platform is at your sole risk.
        </p>

        <h4>4. User Responsibility</h4>
        <p>
          Users are solely responsible for their actions, decisions, and
          communications while using Kampus Abode. It is your responsibility to
          evaluate the reliability and safety of any listings, properties, or
          individuals you interact with.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Use of Third-Party Services</h4>
        <p>
          The platform may link to or use third-party services. Kampus Abode is
          not responsible for the content, security, or policies of these
          external providers.
        </p>

        <h4>6. Changes to This Disclaimer</h4>
        <p>
          Kampus Abode may revise this Disclaimer at any time. Updates will be
          reflected on this page with a revised “Last Updated” date. Continued
          use of the platform indicates acceptance of any changes.
