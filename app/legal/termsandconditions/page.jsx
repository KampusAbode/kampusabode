        <p>Last Updated: 07-14-2024</p>

        <h4>1. Acceptance of Terms</h4>
        <p>
          By accessing or using Kampus Abode (“we,” “us,” or “our”), you agree
          to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms and Conditions. If
          you do not agree, you may not use the platform.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Eligibility</h4>
        <p>
          Kampus Abode is designed for members of the student community looking
          for accommodation ("tenants") and individuals or organizations
          offering verified listings ("agents"). By signing up, you agree to use
          the platform for its intended purpose and represent that the
          information you provide is true and accurate.
        </p>

        <h4>3. User Accounts</h4>
        <p>
          You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
          account credentials. You agree to provide accurate, up-to-date
          information during account creation and while using the platform.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Kampus Abode’s Role</h4>
        <p>
          Kampus Abode acts solely as a listing platform that connects students
          with available accommodations through verified property listings.
          Kampus Abode does not own or manage properties, nor is it a real
          estate agency. All agreements made between tenants and agents are
          their sole responsibility.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Listings and Verification</h4>
        <p>
          Agents may create and manage listings, which must include accurate
          details about the property. While Kampus Abode does not currently
          conduct formal background verification, each listing is reviewed
          before being published. If a listing is found to contain false or
          misleading information, the agent will be notified to correct the
          issue or risk removal of the listing.
        </p>

        <h4>6. Reviews and Ratings</h4>
        <p>
          Kampus Abode allows tenants to post reviews and rate their experience
          with properties and agents. Reviews must be respectful, truthful, and
          free from harassment, hate speech, or defamatory content. Kampus Abode
          reserves the right to remove any review that violates these standards.
        </p>

        <h4>7. Dispute Resolution</h4>
        <p>
          In the event of a dispute related to inaccurate listings or agent
          behavior, Kampus Abode may intervene by requesting evidence and
          facilitating communication between parties. However, Kampus Abode is
          not liable for damages or losses arising from such disputes.
        </p>

        <h4>8. User Conduct</h4>
        <p>
          You agree not to misuse the platform. This includes, but is not
          limited to, posting fraudulent listings, using false identities,
          spamming, harassment, or attempting to manipulate reviews. Any
          violation may lead to suspension or termination of your account.
        </p>

        <h4>9. Platform Availability</h4>
        <p>
          Kampus Abode reserves the right to update, modify, or temporarily
          suspend the platform or its features at any time without notice.
        </p>

        <h4>10. Modifications to Terms</h4>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in our
          services, policies, or legal obligations. All updates will be
          communicated through this page, and continued use of the platform
          after changes implies acceptance of the revised Terms.
        </p>

        <h4>11. Contact Information</h4>
